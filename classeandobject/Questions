Certainly! Here are some exercises related to the topic of Classes and Objects in Java. These exercises will help you practice creating classes, defining attributes, and working with objects:

Create a Student Class:
Define a Student class with fields like name, age, and studentID. Create methods to set and retrieve these attributes. Then, create objects of the Student class and print their information.

Bank Account:
Create a BankAccount class with fields for accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance. Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing money from the account, and for displaying the current balance.
